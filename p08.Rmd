In this portfolio, I learned the package Rayrender, which build 3D scenes using basic shapes and materials. 

```{r}
#install.packages("rayrender")
library(rayrender)
```

```{r}
# Scene setup
scene <- generate_cornell() %>% #creates a Cornell Box scene â€” a classic 3D test room used in computer graphics.
  add_object(sphere(x = 278, y = 200, z = 278, radius = 100,
                    material = dielectric(color = "white", refraction = 1.5))) %>%
  #Adds a glass-like sphere to the center of the scene.
  add_object(sphere(x = 200, y = 300, z = 300, radius = 50,
                    material = diffuse(color = "purple"))) %>%
  #Adds a second diffuse purple sphere (matte surface, no shine) at a higher point.
  add_object(sphere(x = 350, y = 150, z = 200, radius = 40,
                    material = diffuse(color = "cyan")))
render_scene(scene, samples = 500, fov = 40, clamp_value = 5)
#This actually renders the image (i.e., simulates light rays and creates the final picture).
```
